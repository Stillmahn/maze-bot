# maze-bot

The line following maze bot is designed to follow a line of tape using two sensors. During the alotted time, the sensors were configured, along with wheel functionality. The Woulda-Shoulda-Coulda branch shows what could have worked as a line following algorithm, while the main branch is a working demo programmed onto the robot.
